publication date only; detailed notes begin with the Unreleased section.

## Unreleased

- Load the CLI entry as an ES module (`src/index.mjs`) so `commander` — which
  is ESM-only — no longer triggers Node's `ExperimentalWarning` on every run;
  the test harness no longer silences warnings, so it sees what users see
  (#300).
- Report a stylesheet as malformed for any well-formedness problem the XML
  parser reports, not only the fatal ones — an undefined entity or a stray
  `<` no longer slips through — and route the parser's own diagnostics through
  the logger instead of leaking them to the console (#298).
- Assert behavior rather than whole-corpus totals in the end-to-end tests, so
  adding a fixture or a rule no longer breaks an unrelated test (#303).
- Use bare module names in `require` (drop the `node:` prefix) and enforce it
  with an ESLint rule; collapse the duplicate `warn`/`warning` naming in the
  logger and writer (#304).
- Apply `--log-level`/`--quiet` before reading the configuration, rule
  patterns, and suppressions, so a raised level now silences their warnings
  too (#299).
- Color output only for an interactive terminal and honor `NO_COLOR`, so
  redirected or piped output no longer carries raw ANSI escapes (#302).
- Report and ignore `.xslint.yml` values of the wrong type — a non-numeric
  `max-warnings` no longer silently disables the warning gate (#301).
- Add machine-readable output: `--format json` and `--format sarif` (SARIF
  2.1.0, for GitHub code scanning) alongside the default `text` (#260).
- Add inline suppression directives — `xslint-disable-next-line`,
  `xslint-disable-line`, and `xslint-disable-file` (#262), and report a
  directive that suppresses nothing as unused (#288).
- **Breaking:** drop the `template-match-` prefix from every rule name and
  rationalize a few awkward ones, so `--suppress` strings and config `rules`
  keys change accordingly; add a conformance test that enforces rule naming,
  motives, and test packs (#258).
- Add a `.xslint.yml` configuration file — rule severities and globs,
  `exclude`, `max-warnings`, `log-level`, `quiet` — resolved with `--config`
  and walk-up discovery (#261, #282, #283, #284, #285).
- Add c8 coverage measurement with a 90% gate and a Codecov badge (#265).
- Add scheduled Stryker mutation testing (#266).
- Parse each XPath rule once at load instead of once per file (#256).
- Compute each tokenizer probe once per position (#255).
- Apply the schema-type and node-set rules to XSLT 3.0 stylesheets (#259).
- Make the exit code severity-aware and add `--max-warnings` (#264).
- Send logs to stderr and defects to stdout, and add `--quiet` (#263).
- Add round-trip and offset property tests for the tokenizer (#267).
- Point the README badges at this repository (#254).
